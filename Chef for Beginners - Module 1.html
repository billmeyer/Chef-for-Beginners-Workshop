# Chef for Beginners
## Introduction

# Bill Meyer
## Sr. Solutions Architect

This Chef Workshop provides a basic understanding of Chef's core components, basic architecture, commonly used tools, and basic troubleshooting methods.

This should provide you with enough knowledge to start using Chef to automate common infrastructure tasks and express solutions to common infrastructure problems.

Instructor Note: Be sure to read Appendix Z for training lab set up notes and additional instructor notes. Important: This workshop requires ChefDK version 0.8.1. If you use a later version such as 0.9.0, the exercises and labs won’t work properly.

Chef is not, in itself, a solution to your infrastructure problems.  Chef is an automation framework.  You bring the domain expertise about your own business and its problems.  Chef provides a platform for modeling solutions to those problems.  Our job in this class is to work together to teach you how to express solutions to your unique problems with Chef.

Together we get unicorns and rainbows, but we can't have one without the other.

Chef is a large set of tools that are able to be used on multiple platforms and in numerous configurations. We will have time to only explore some of its most fundamental pieces.

Learning Chef is like learning a language. You will reach fluency very fast but it will take practice until you become comfortable.

# Chef - Lab System Architecture

.right-column[
* In this workshop you will use a pre-built virtual workstation with all the necessary tools already installed
so you can start using Chef right away.
]

---
# SSH Into the Remote Workstation

```bash
$ ssh <ipaddress> -l chef
```

--

or

```bash
$ ssh chef@<ipaddress>
```
	
???
You should use an ssh client like PuTTY to connect to the remote workstation that we assign to you. You'll need to ssh into your assigned workstation in order to issue Chef commands.

Instructor Note: You should assign the participants their Day 1 virtual workstations (AMIs) at this time. The login credentials and password for the virtual workstations is chef/chef.

---
# Getting a Workstation

The __chef__ user has been granted password-less sudoers access.

The following software is installed on the remote workstation:

* Chef DK
* Docker
* kitchen-docker gem
